 ********** Coding Challenge #1 **********

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.

§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

GOOD LUCK �

// Task 1:
const markMass = 78;
const markHeight = 1.69;
const johnMass = 92;
const johnHeight = 1.95;

// const markMass = 95;
// const markHeight = 1.88;
// const johnMass = 85;
// const johnHeight = 1.76;

// Task 2
const markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
const johnBMI = johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);

console.log({ markBMI }, { johnBMI });

// Task 3
const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
console.log({ markHigherBMI });
